# chuck-norris-jokes-generator

This is my first attempt at working with external APIs. This webpage gets data from the Internet Chuck Norris Database, http://www.icndb.com/api/, via it's api and it generates jokes based on the number you inputed.

I worked with Skeleton Boilerplate (for CSS styling) to do this.
